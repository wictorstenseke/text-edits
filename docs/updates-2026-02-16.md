# Dependency Updates - February 16, 2026

## Summary

This update brings all TipTap editor extensions to the latest 3.19.0 version, ensuring consistency across the editor stack and incorporating the latest bug fixes and improvements.

## Updated Packages

### TipTap Packages (3.18.0 → 3.19.0)

All TipTap packages have been aligned to version 3.19.0:

- `@tiptap/extension-link`
- `@tiptap/extension-mention`
- `@tiptap/extension-placeholder`
- `@tiptap/extension-table`
- `@tiptap/extension-table-cell`
- `@tiptap/extension-table-header`
- `@tiptap/extension-table-row`
- `@tiptap/react`
- `@tiptap/starter-kit`

**Why:** Ensures all TipTap extensions are on the same version, reducing potential compatibility issues and bringing in the latest improvements.

### Router Tooling

- `@tanstack/router-cli`: 1.141.2 → 1.160.0

**Why:** Keeps the route generation tooling up-to-date with the router library version (1.160.0).

### Internationalization

- `i18next`: 25.8.5 → 25.8.10

**Why:** Minor version update with bug fixes and improvements to the i18n library.

### Utilities

- `tailwind-merge`: 3.4.0 → 3.4.1

**Why:** Patch update with minor improvements to the utility for merging Tailwind CSS classes.

## Testing Results

- ✅ All 81 unit tests passing
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ ESLint checks passing
- ✅ Full production build successful
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities detected

## Deferred Updates

### ESLint v10

ESLint v10.0.0 is available (currently on 9.39.2), but this is a major version upgrade that may require:
- Configuration file updates
- Plugin compatibility checks
- Rule adjustments

**Recommendation:** Plan this as a separate update with dedicated testing time.

### Vite

Rolldown Vite 7.3.1 is available (currently on 7.2.11), but we're using a specialized fork (`rolldown-vite`) rather than standard Vite, so updates should be carefully evaluated against the fork's release schedule.

## Impact

These updates are all minor/patch versions within their semver ranges, so they should be backward compatible. All existing functionality has been verified through the test suite.

## Future Maintenance

To keep dependencies up-to-date:

```bash
# Check for outdated packages
npm outdated

# Update packages within semver range
npm update

# Check for security vulnerabilities
npm audit
```
