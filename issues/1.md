### Add Language Support for English and Swedish

To enhance the usability and accessibility of the **text-edits** repository, we need to implement language support for English and Swedish. Leveraging a well-known library or plugin for handling translations can simplify the implementation and ensure robustness.

### Tasks:
1. Research and select a widely-used library or plugin for managing multilingual support (e.g., i18next, LinguiJS).
2. Integrate the selected library/plugin into the project.
3. Add English as the default language.
4. Include Swedish as an option.
5. Document the workflow for adding additional languages in the future.

### Expected Outcome:
Users should be able to toggle between English and Swedish effectively. The implementation should also accommodate easy scaling to support other languages as required.

### Additional Notes:
Choose a lightweight solution that balances performance with flexibility.
