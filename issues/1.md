### Description:
To enhance the usability and accessibility of the **text-edits** repository, we need to implement language support for English and Swedish. Leveraging a well-known library or plugin for handling translations can simplify the implementation and ensure robustness.

### Tasks:
1. Research and select a widely-used library or plugin for managing multiple language support. Examples include i18next, LinguiJS, or similar.
2. Implement the selected library/plugin into the codebase.
3. Add English as the default language.
4. Add Swedish language support.
5. Create documentation or reference instructions on how to add more languages in the future.

### Expected Outcome:
The application should be able to dynamically switch between English and Swedish languages based on user preference or browser settings.

### Additional Comments:
Consider lightweight solutions to avoid unnecessary complexity while ensuring scalability for adding more languages in the future.
