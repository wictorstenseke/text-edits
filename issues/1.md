### Title: Add Language Support for English and Swedish

**Body:** To enhance the usability and accessibility of the text-edits repository, we need to implement language support for English and Swedish. Leveraging a well-known library or plugin for handling translations can simplify the implementation and ensure robustness.

**Tasks:** 
- Research and select a widely-used library or plugin for managing multiple language support (e.g., i18next, LinguiJS).
- Integrate the selected library/plugin into the project.
- Add English as the default language.
- Include Swedish as an option.
- Document the workflow for adding additional languages in the future.

**Expected Outcome:** Users should be able to toggle between English and Swedish effectively. The implementation should also accommodate easy scaling to support other languages as required.

**Additional Notes:** Choose a lightweight solution that balances performance with flexibility.
